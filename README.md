## 📝 Project Description
### This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict the closing stock prices of major tech companies such as AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN using historical time series data. The model aims to capture patterns and trends in stock price movements over time.
## 🎯 Project Goals
- Predict stock price based on past price data
- Build and train an LSTM model to handle sequential (time-series) financial data.
- Evaluate model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
## 🔧 Technologies and Libraries Used
- Pyhthon
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- yfinance
## 📊 Dataset
### The dataset consists of historical stock data retrieved from Yahoo Finance for the following companies:
